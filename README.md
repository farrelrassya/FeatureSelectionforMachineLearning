# FeatureSelectionforMachineLearning
Feature Selection for Machine Learning -- Learn filter, wrapper, and embedded methods, recursive feature elimination, exhaustive search, feature shuffling &amp; more.

What will you learn? I have put together a fantastic collection of feature selection techniques, based on scientific articles, data science competitions and of course my own experience as a data scientist.
Specifically, you will learn:
1. How to remove features with low variance
2. How to identify redundant features
3. How to select features based on statistical tests
4. How to select features based on changes in model performance
5. How to find predictive features based on importance attributed by models
6. How to code procedures elegantly and in a professional manner
7. How to leverage the power of existing Python libraries for feature selection

Throughout the course, you are going to learn multiple techniques for each of the mentioned tasks, and you will learn to implement these techniques in an elegant, efficient, and professional manner, using Python, Scikit-learn, pandas and mlxtend. At the end of the course, you will have a variety of tools to select and compare different feature subsets and identify the ones that returns the simplest, yet most predictive machine learning model. This will allow you to minimize the time to put your predictive models into production.
